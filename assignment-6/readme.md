<h1>assingment 6 report</h1>

I chose the 90's and 2 graphics that reminded
me of a mirror that hung in my parent's entryway
for many years. I was born in 1985, so my
childhood was during the 90s.

The color pallette I chose included the colors:
#ff6699
#ffcc66
#ccff33
#660099
#330066


The only problem I ran into was that my image
floated on top of my main block
I wanted to nest it inside of the main block.
Instead it sits on top and covers
whatever blocks it wants. It iss very frustrating.

I am glad we are finally on CSS, now to get it to
do what I want.

My work cycle consisted of following the tutorial,
referencing the review section
and watching tutorials on YouTube. I started with
index, then worked on the css.
It was pretty straight forward, but I never
figured out how to get the stupid
graphic to sit still.
