<h1>assignment 7 report</h1>

I chose ataris.txt because I'm a gamer. I would love to make game trailers or art for games.

System fonts are on the computer. ie: Microstoft Word.
Web fonts are hosted on a server.
Web-safe fonts are common fonts that are shared between PC and Mac.

My work cycle consisted of following the tutorial,
referencing the review section
and watching tutorials on YouTube. I started with
index, then worked on the css. And a lot of back and forth.
