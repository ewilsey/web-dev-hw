<h1>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</h1>

I went to the The Literature Network website connected to the Contine Reading button and looked at their color palette and selected 3 colors that I liked. I then chose the fonts Indie Flower and Comfortaa because I liked their roundness. I chose comic-sans as a back up because I was familiar with its shape.

System fonts are already installed on your computer. Web fonts are hosted from the web. Websafe fonts are readily available system fonts available on both Windows and Mac. Fallback fonts are secondary options if your primary font should fail for some reason.

The first time I did this assignment I couldn't get anything to work so I used another student's work as a template but become even more confused than before. In the end, I ran out of time and did not change enough for the work to be considered my own.

This attempt was much easier. I was able to implement a lot from what I learned on A-8. I discovered where I kept making simple mistakes and learned how to catch them in the future. Simple things like making sure to type the px after the number when specifying pixel size, and checking to make sure the directory is spelled correctly. And most importantly: doing the work myself. I am embarrassed that it happened, but I am thankful for the opportunity to correct my mistake.
