<h1>assignment 8 report</h1>

Padding is the space between the content and the border. The border is the space
around the padding. The margin is the space around the border and other box elements.

The hardest part of the assignment was using the span element in terms of positioning.
For the most part my piece reflects the ad but the patent info is in the wrong spot.
I was able to successfully span it with the woman image, but I could not figure out how
to move it after that. I spent hours thinking about it. Finally, it seems like such a small
part and it doesn't distract from the piece so I left it.

This turned out to be a pretty good assignment. I was able to fix a lot of
things that I kept missing in the last assignment. I know now how important
it is to properly label things. Multiple times I ran into the issue of things
not moving where I wanted because I forgot to add px to the end of the number.
It had me very frustrated.

This assignment took me roughly 9 hours to complete. I had fun. I could spend the next
two hours trying to figure out how to move a <p> element in a span element, but I'm
gonna call it good instead.
